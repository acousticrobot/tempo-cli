# The Views Reporter is responsible for presenting all the views
# using the specified formatters. The Reporter is initialized in the GLI pre block,
# where all additional formats are added.
# The reporter executes the reports during the post block, displaying all views that
# have been added by the views.
#
# class instance variables:
#
# @@formats
#   an array of formatters, which will be passed the view records on exit
#   Reporter will always run the error formater first, to check for errors in
#   the view reports, followed by all added formatters, and then finally the screen
#   formatter.  This allows additional formatters to add view records, which
#   will be presented on screen.
#
# @@view_records
#   add view_records
